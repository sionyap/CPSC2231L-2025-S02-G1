## üìò Overview

This project is part of the semester-long software development assignment for CPSC 2231L.
The goal of Milestone 1 is to build the foundation for a text analysis tool that preprocesses and analyzes multiple text articles about the same topic.

The program currently performs the following:

- Loads multiple text files (articles) from a folder.
- Removes stop words (common words like ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúbut‚Äù, etc.).
- Calculates basic text statistics (total words, unique words, word frequency).
- Ranks words by their frequency of occurrence.

All preprocessing is done for one topic (folder) at a time.

## üß± Project Structure

The project uses an object-oriented architecture with four classes:

| File	| Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Main.java	| Entry point of the program. Handles user input and coordinates analysis of articles using a while loop to display a user interface menu. (Currently incomplete --- focus was on functionality between `ArticleStats.java` and other classes.) |
| FileLoader.java	| Loads all text files from a specified directory (topic folder) by adding all .txt files within one topic to an ArrayList of Strings for `ArticleStats.java` to iterate through and analyze individually. |
| StopWords.java	| Stores (via a predetermined stopwords.txt file) and filters out common English stop words using the `removeStopWords(ArrayList<String> articleWords)` method (creates the ArrayList of stop words, using an `Itorator`) from the article being iterated through in `ArticleStats.java`. |
| ArticleStats.java |	Through the main method, first iterates into a new text file, reading it line by line, and concatenating each line to create a large string consisting of all article text; assigns words in the article into an a `wordArray` using a delimiter and converting this Array into an ArrayList for comparison. Then, processes given text via `FileLoader.java` to calculate article statistics (storing unique words, their counts, and overall word count in respective ArrayLists) and, using `sortByRank(ArrayList<String> words, ArrayList<Integer> wordCounts)`, generate ranked word frequencies by aligning words to their frequencies across ArrayLists `words` and `wordCounts`, displaying (printing) them side by side in order of occurrences. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Place your article .txt files in a folder (one topic per folder).

Ensure the folder path is correctly referenced in Main.java.

Compile all Java files (as applicable):

```javac Main.java FileLoader.java StopWords.java ArticleStats.java```

Run the program:

```java Main.java```

The program will:
- Read all text files from the specified directory.
- Remove stop words.
- Display word counts, unique word counts, and top frequent words.
